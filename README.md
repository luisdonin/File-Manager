# GTK File Manager

This is a simple file manager built using the GTK library in C++. It allows you to create, read, write, and delete files using a graphical user interface.

## Installation

To build and run the file manager, you will need to have the GTK development libraries installed on your system. On Ubuntu or Debian, you can install the libraries by running the following command in the terminal:

```
sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev
```

Once the libraries are installed, you can build the file manager by running the following command in the terminal:

```
g++ -o file_manager main.cpp `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0`
```

This will create an executable file called `file_manager`. You can run the file manager by executing this file in the terminal:

```
./file_manager
```

## Usage

The file manager has a simple graphical user interface with four buttons:

- Create a file: Allows you to create a new file by specifying a filename.
- Read a file: Allows you to read the contents of a file by selecting a file from the file system.
- Write to a file: Allows you to write to a file by selecting a file from the file system and entering the content to be written.
- Delete a file: Allows you to delete a file by selecting a file from the file system.
